# Unnamed game

Creative name for my latest hobby project. It is a 2D platformer game with swords and jumping skeletons.

Made using an engine written from scratch in `C++` and `SFML`.

## Installation

The compiled version is waiting in the build folder.

## Controls

* **WSAD** for moving around
* **T** for slashing
* **F1** for multiplayer (2nd player uses arrows for movement and + for attack)
* **F5** for reset
* **ESC** to quit
